# Setting up a powerful API with GraphQL, Koa and MongoDB 

Koa is a Node framework just like Express and Hapi - we will be replacing the usual Express with Koa 
since Koa uses async/await syntax over callbacks.

## Getting Started 

The pre-requisities for building the API are the following: 

* NodeJS 
* Text Editor - Visual Studio Code for this project 
* Terminal 
* Browser 


Once we have these items, we can begin creating the project. Navigate to the appropriate project 
folder and run the following command: 

```
npm init
```
